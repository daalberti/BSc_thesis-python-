# BSc_thesis-python-
All python codes used for the analysis in my bachelor thesis.

- Codes are structured to created geodataframes as intermediate steps. This is done for visual inspection in a GIS-software such as QGIS.
- Codes ar enumarated for the correct order of execution
- Aggregated analysis is done last, as it uses files created in the regional analyses.
